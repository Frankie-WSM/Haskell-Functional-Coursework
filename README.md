# Haskell-Functional-Coursework
This code is written in Haskell and was our coursework for a module that first introduced us to functional programming in my first semester of university. 

Note - Unfortunately I wasn't able to complete sections 4 and 5 before the deadline, and the code of some other questions may be somewhat inefficient.
